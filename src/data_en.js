      about:
        "I am Berkkan Rençber. I graduated from Marmara University Computer Science Engineering (English) department. To improve myself, I worked to gain insight into many programming languages throughout my education life. These were languages such as C#, Node.js, Java, Javascript, Kotlin, Python, and C. I actively used Java and C languages in the 1st and 2nd years of the university, and Python and C# languages were taught in the 3rd and 4th years. Apart from the projects I did at university, I had the opportunity to develop 2 mobile games, 4 mobile application, and 1 advanced website. I am a student in the Fullstack Pro Program at Workintech, where I am improving my skills in JavaScript, React, SQL, Java, and Spring Boot. ",
